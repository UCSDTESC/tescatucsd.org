						The Student Travel Fund is a financial resource providing support for
						Jacobs School of Engineering undergraduate students to attend
						conferences and competitions. It covers travel expenses like
						transportation and hotel costs, as well as conference fees. This fund
						can be used by students to
						cover costs associated with their participation in academic or
						professional events. The fund is a gift derived from proceeds of the
						Jacobs School Ring Ceremony and is intended to support student
						development opportunities. This year, TESC is responsible for
						managing the application process and reviewing applications. Contact us at <a href="mailto:board@tesc.ucsd.edu" style={{ textDecoration: "underline" }}>board@tesc.ucsd.edu</a> if you have questions or concerns about the process.
